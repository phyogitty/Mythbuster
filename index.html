			Boba is a popular topping tea beverages(although it is always seen sinking at the bottom of the cup)<br><br> It is found in milk tea, also called "bubble tea", "pearl tea" or simply "boba tea," the cold drink originated from Taiwan. <br><br>The most consumed boba has black color, and the texture is soft and chewy.

			The boba drinks widely spreaded across Asia, the boba shops has multiplied over time in North America, as well as it got famous in the Europe, especially Germany. <br><br>
   			The myth about boba started with the release of the research from University Hospital Aachen, Germany. <br> <br>
   			What was the finding?
   			According to the report of the German researcher, Manfred Möller, of the Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicin at Aachen, the tapioca contain <strong>stryrene</strong>, <strong>acetophenone</strong> and other <strong>unspecified brominated chemicals</strong>.<br><br> These chemicals, they said, "shouldn't be in food at all" and they are considered by those German researchers and the media to relate to polychlorinated biphenyls(PCB), which reportedly can cause cancer and other harmful health effects in animals and humans.
<br><br>
			Many secondary reports among the foreign mass media, and cancer-related concerns among the boba drink consumers arise from that finding from Germany. The news also concerned parents because their teenager kids are loving and drinking various kinds of boba beverages.<br><br>

				<h1><mark class="m"><strong>Myth Busted!</strong></mark>
			         <br><mark class="n"><strong>* Boba does not cause cancer *</strong></mark></h1>

			(1) <strong>The study by German researchers is flawed.</strong><br>
			<ul class="a">
			   	<li>UC Berkeley assessed that there was no official publication, and thus the finding was not peer-reviewed.</li>
			   	<li> Online media, Daily News, reports that "Samples were taken from an unnamed chain in Mönchengladbach, in northwest Germany and the tapioca balls were made in Taiwan."</li>
			   	<li> The quantity of boba was not also specified.</li>
			 </ul>
			<br><br>

			(2) <strong>Under Taiwanese government's authority, the Cosumer Protection Comittee tested and confirmed that tapioca pearls are safe to consume. 
			</strong><ul class="a">
				<li>They tested 22 samples from 7 manufacturers in Taiwan</li>
				<li>They did not find styrene and acetophenone in all samples</li>
				<li>However, unlike German researchers, they specifically found brominated biphenyls.</li>
				<li>According to the statement on Polybrominated Biphenyls (PBBs) by Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, "the amounts of PBBs that caused health effects in animals are much greater than levels of PBBs normally found in the environment." That means that those chemicals cannot be easily harmful to humans. </li>
				
			</ul>

			<br><br>
	        (3) <strong>US FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) states that styrene and acetophenone are not PCB.</strong><br>
	        <ul class="a">
	        	<li>In fact, FDA approved styrene and acetophenone to be used in food production.</li>
	        	<li>They are not chemically related to PCB as well.</li>
	        </ul>
	       </article>

	<h2 class="qq">Molecular Structures of Styrene, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, and Acetophenone<br><em style="color:orange">Let's learn more about the chemicals which are claimed to be in boba and get rid of or at least reduce our health concerns</em></h2>
	


<a href="#sty" class="tooltip"><img class="t" src="images/styrene.png" alt="styrene"><span>Styrene<br><br>Styrene is a colorless liquid that evaporates easily, and it has a sweet smell. Styrene is naturally found in foods such as coffee beans, strawberries, cinnamon and peanuts. Polymerised styrene(in solid state) are used in the manufacture of plastic containers and packaging materials for vehicles.<br><br>>>>   A small amount of styrene that we may be exposed through inhalation and consumption of food is not harmful to our bodies. Many studies and experiments have shown that styrene is not associated with severe health risk, including cancer.<br><br>Next time, if any faulty studies asserted that styrene was in the food you love like German research claimed about tapioca balls used in dessert beverages, you will be less panicked and less concerned by that chemical.</span></a>

<a href="#" class="tooltip"><img class="t" src="images/pcb-use.png" alt="pcb"><span>Polychlorinated Biphenyls<br><br>PCBs are a group of synthetic chemicals. They were massively produced in US and Europe. However, the manufacture of PCBs is now highly banned in many countries due to their potential dangerous impact on humans' health and environment. <br><br>PCBs are hardly soluble in water, but easily in fat. PCBs are especially found in animal fats, which may be in our food chain. They can also build up by contamination in harvested fish and other source of food.<br><br>>>>  Therefore, since boba is made of tapioca starch, which mostly lack fat as mentioned above, there is no or little chance that PCBs can build up in boba unless tapioca starch, the source of ingredient for boba, is somehow contaminated. In fact, we can be free from concerns as long as we eat good amount of non-contaminated food
</span></a>

<a href="#" class="tooltip"><img class="t" src="images/acetophenone.png" alt="acetophenone"><span>Acetophenone<br><br>Acetophenone is a colorless, viscous liquid and it has sweet smell and taste. Like styrene, it also can be found naturally in fruits and vegetables, such as apple, banana and cauliflower; and also cheese and beef. The chemical is used in many industrial production, for example, resin, plastics, fragance like soup and perfumes, and some pharmaceuticals.<br><br>>>>   U.S. Environmental protection agency labeled acetophenone as a Group D carcinogen; which means that it does not take part in any cancer development in human body.<br><br>If we are familiar with the chemical, we can be free from having second thoughs about enjoying our favorite food after hearing rumor-like scientific information

	<h1 class="o">What does drinking Boba Tea really do to your body?</h1>
	   It can lead to obesity. <br><br>
	Boba or tapioca ball contains large amount of carbohydrates, but low nutritional value. <br><br>
	Additional carbs from sugar and toppings to the drink also add up too!<br><br>
	However, we can customize our milk tea as we want and enjoy our boba!
