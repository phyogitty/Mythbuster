What is Boba?
Boba is a popular topping (although it is always seen sinking at the bottom of the cup) in milk tea, also called "bubble tea", "pearl tea" or simply "boba tea," the cold drink originated from Taiwan. The most consumed boba has black color, and the texture is sofy and chewy. 

What is Boba made of?
Boba is made of tapioca starch which comes from cassava root. The boba, tapioca ball, itself is tasteless. It is usually sugar-coated and used in the drink. 

Boba causes cancer?
   The boba drinks widely spreaded across Asia, the boba shops has multiplied over time in North America, as well as it got famous in the Europe, especially Germany. 
   The myth about boba started with the release of the research from University Hospital Aachen, Germany.
   According to the report of the German researcher, Manfred Möller, of the Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicin at Aachen, the tapioca contain stryrene, acetophrnone and other brominated chemicals. These chemicals "shouldn't be in food at all" and the are considered by those German researchers and the media to relate to polychlorinated biphenyls(PCB), which reportedly can cause cancer and other harmful health effects in animals and humans.

   many secondary reports amond the foreign mass media and cancer-related concerns among the boba drink consumers arise from that finding from Germany. The news also concerned parents because their teenager kids are loving and drinking various kinds of boba beverages. 

Myth busted

The finding has not gone through 
"In addition, the German report was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, so the study itself was not evaluated by other scientific experts to ensure its accuracy."


"One reason why the media may have hyped this story on tapioca pearls is because Taiwan has been no stranger to controversies about contamination in food products. "


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also weighed in. According to Noah Bartolucci, an FDA spokesperson, acetophenone and styrene are not PCBs because they are neither chlorinated nor biphenyls


The Taiwanese government soon became involved in this imbroglio—a lot of money was at stake. The Consumer Protection Committee in Taiwan did a round of testing, collecting 22 samples of tapioca pearls from seven manufacturers, and concluded that none contained styrene. The agency did find brominated biphenyls and acetophenone, but the quantity was too small to create any health concerns. Unfortunately, the sample size was very small and the details of their analysis have not been made available.
